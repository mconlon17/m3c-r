# Using R on the M3C People Portal data

The [M3C People Portal](https://people.metabolomics.info) organizes public information about the work of 
researchers in the field of metabolomics.  People, Organizations, Studies, and Publications are organized by 
study, author, and organization.

Data is represented using a small ontology based on the VIVO Ontology.

Data is available as RDF.

R is used to read the data, perform SPARQL queries for tabulations and reports, and for social network analysis.
